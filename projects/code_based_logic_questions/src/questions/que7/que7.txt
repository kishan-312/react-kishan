✅ Category 1 — State Update & Re-render Logic


// directly state update doesn't triggeer re-render
Question 6

Consider this code:

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Kishan");

  function updateName() {
    name = "Mistry";
    console.log(name);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <button onClick={updateName}>Change Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

❓ When you click the button:

What prints in the console?

Does the UI update?

Why?

✅ Answer
Part	Result
Console Output	"Mistry"
UI Display	Still shows: Kishan (UI does NOT update)
Reason	Direct variable reassign does not trigger re-render
🧠 Explanation
Key Issue:

You are not using setName to update state.

This line:

name = "Mistry";


Only changes the local variable, not the React state.

React does not know anything changed → no re-render.

To update UI, you must call:

setName("Mistry");


React then triggers re-render and updates screen.

✅ Correct Version:
function updateName() {
  setName("Mistry");
}


Now UI becomes:

Mistry ✅

🎯 Interview Key Statement (Say this confidently)

Updating state variables directly does not trigger re-render because React tracks state only when setState / setX functions are used. State must be updated immutably through its setter function.
